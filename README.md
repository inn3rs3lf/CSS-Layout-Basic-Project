# CSS-Layout-Basic-Project
Basic responsive site for treehouse project
This was a small project within the greater Tech Degree from Team Treehouse. 

We were provided with a mockup in which to follow. 

The mockup provided three layouts, one for single column (Mobile first), two column and finally a third full page layout. 

It was my first design that was reponsive, using floats and media queries.
